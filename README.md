### Usage:
- Navigate to "%appdata%/.minecraft/versions" and place the contents of the zip file in there. In the minecraft launcher create a new installation and scroll down
to Tidal.
- Once you launch the client, press get key in order to get a key to get access to the client!

### Story:
Ever since I abandoned peroxide, I always wanted to make another client. The biggest reason developers quit developing their client after releasing is because they
do not feel like there is a purpose to maintaining a free client. I felt similarly, I tried to monetize Peroxide to no avail. Recently I downloaded peroxide myself
and played around with it on hypixel a little bit. I used the autoclicker as I didn't want to get banned but that resparked my interest. I knew that if I sat there
because I knew if i made a free client I would get bored and probably discontinue the client, however I also knew making the client paid would not turn out well either.
I found the best of both worlds which is a key system. I worked countless hours perfecting my key system. Long story short users click get key in the client which takes
them to a link shortener. This link shortener gives me a small payout every time someone completes it. This allows me to keep the client 100% free of charge while profiting
which makes it the best of both worlds. I'm currently in high school and I aspire to go to college one day and I desire to use this project to help build up savings
for when the time comes to go college. Just using the client greatly benefits me and every user matters.
